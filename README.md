## Hi there 👋

Im Berk, 24 years old and currently an IT: Cyber security student at the Inholland university of applied sciences.

## About me:

I’m a cybersecurity student in Amsterdam who spends way too much time building and breaking tech. Most days I’m tinkering with Raspberry Pi’s, ESP32 boards, or Docker containers, sometimes for self-hosting, sometimes just because it’s fun to watch things crash. I like building random tools like USB attack detectors or ESP32 gadgets that have no business existing, but hey, they work (most of the time).

My ADHD makes sure I’m always juggling five projects at once: debugging code that broke for no reason, soldering something shiny I just thought of, and forgetting what I was supposed to finish in the first place. When I’m not chasing the next distraction, I’m probably on my motorcycle or messing with creative projects that mash electronics, video, and art together. Basically, if it beeps, blinks, or breaks, I’m into it.

### My interests:
- Cybersecurity
- ESP32 based development
- Backend development

### My current hyperfixations: 
- 🔭 I’m currently working on personal projects like a product locator for a store and a task manager thats connected to a receipt printer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and Typescript

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on
- ESP32 or embedded (security) projects  
- Weird self-hosted tools nobody asked for but everyone ends up using

### 🛠️ Tools I often ~~break~~ use
- ESP-IDF / PlatformIO
- Docker / Proxmox  
- Python, C++, Typescript  
- Soldering iron + too much coffee
